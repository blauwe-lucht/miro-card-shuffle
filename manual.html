    <h1>Card shuffle</h1>
    <p>This plugin makes it possible to simulate a deck of playing cards. Follow these steps:
    <ul>
      <li>Create front sides by either making an object containing text or making a group of objects that contains at least one text.</li>
      <li>Create back sides by either making an object <bold>without any</bold> text or making a group of objects <bold>without any</bold> text.</li>
      <li>Make sure the number of back sides is the same as the number of front sides.</li>
      <li>When creating card sides do not use 'Bring to front' or 'Send to back', the plugin will ignore those when shuffling the cards.</li>
      <li>Select all front and back sides that will together form a card deck.</li>
      <li>Press 'cardshuffle'.</li>
      <li>Deselect the deck.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>The result will be a stack of cards with alternating back and front sides, with the front sides in random order. Every time you use 'cardshuffle' the
    deck will be stacked and shuffled. You can now select the top (back) side, move it away to show the first front side.
    Repeat until the deck is empty.</p>
    <p>Note: an object contains text when it's a text object or an object containing text (for example a sticky note or a shape).</p>
